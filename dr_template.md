### Descriptions
More detailed descriptions of each asset identified above.
- VPC: we have created subnets public and private in each availability zone of each region.
- AMI images are using to hold the application executable. You have to create and store these AMI images in both regions. Also, these AMI images are copied from us-east-1 region.
- EC2 instances for web server: we need to create EC2 in every availability zone in the region
- Keypairs: it is necessary creating a keypair in the 2 regions
- RDS cluster: we are deploying two RDS cluster. One RDS cluster as primary cluster is deployed in us-east-2 region. This RDS cluster has one write instance and one read instance. The another RDS cluster as secondary cluster is deployed in us-west-1 region with replication from the primary cluster in us-east.2. This secondary cluster has 2 read instances.  

## DR Plan
### Pre-Steps:
List steps you would perform to setup the infrastructure in the other region. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but high-level should suffice.
- Create and configure S3 bucket for terraform state. 
- Create AMI image.
- Create a private Keypair with name "udacity".
- Deploy: VPC, Application Load Balancer (ALB), Security groups, EC2 instances web servers and EKS cluster in another region.
- Configure a secondary RDS cluster in us-west-1 region with replication from the primary RDS cluster in us-east-2 region. 
- Code from monitoring stack like: prometheus configuration, Grafana dashboard and alerting; must be stored in a git repository so that in case of failure replicate the same monitoring configuration. 

## Steps:
You won't actually perform these steps, but write out what you would do to "fail-over" your application and database cluster to the other region. Think about all the pieces that were setup and how you would use those in the other region
- The first step is stop RDS instances individually in primary RDS cluster, we need to wait around 2 minutes to stop the two instances. While those instances are stopped. We are going to another cluster, in the secondary region we see that RDS cluster in secondary region with name promoting this to a Regional cluster which is no longer replicate.
- Enable a direct client connection point to directly access the RDS cluster promoted as primary and to access the new writer node and replica node.
- Enable a direct access point to the Flask application to ALB that balances traffic to the secondary region with replicate RDS cluster in case of failure.
- The application must be able to connect and be accessible to the database through DNS/Route 53.
